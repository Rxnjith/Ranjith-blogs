<p>Serving Biryani To Customers
No dreamer is ever too small, no dream ever too big. NR biriyani has come a long way. There are older restaurants and places with cooler backstories maybe, but for nearly 50 years, everyone in Chennai and beyond, young and old, is familiar with ‘RR restaurant’. The early days were tougher times, but We single-handedly made ‘Empire’ possible and together with our friends we ran the business with grit and fervour.

Exotic food like biryani and chickens were served, and also affordable price. They consistently built rapport, making each interaction with customers unique; such was their passion, a sure winner all the way</p>
<p>We established in 1987
Ranjith myself started selling homemade chicken biryani & chicken 65 from a small road side stall in broadway, Chennai. His hard work, perseverance and passion helped to stabilise his business increased in volume steadily over the years.

What’s the secret to his taste recipes? It is his hostel’s secret receipe which he cherishes to this day. This business was later conducted under the name and style of RR Restaurant Pvt Ltd – a brand name which is very popular amongst all biryani lovers. The first eatery was started on a small scale in 1998 in Coimbatore and Madurai with a seating capacity of 8. This eatery was so popular and led the way for starting a series of branches all over city.</p>
